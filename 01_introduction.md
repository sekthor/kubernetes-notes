# Introduction

Most new companies run their applications in the cloud.
Monolithic (Legacy) Applications may prevent estabished companies from entering into the cloud world.
Monolitic Applications are harder to debug, as there is no way to tell what happend in between the entering of a request and it's eventual response, or lack thereof.

## Monolithic Applications

Not every application is fit for the cloud.
Large Monoliths take up a lot of computing resources.
Containters are meant to be lightweight and disposable.

## Microservices

Microservices are loosely coupled.
They split monolithic applications into small singular pieces.
Each service offers a independent piece of functionality of the application.
The Microservices comunicate with each other over a network.
Microservices are scalebale individually.

Microservices can be updated seamlessly, next to no downtime.
They allow for much faster development.
Microservices can be implemented with variing technologies.
